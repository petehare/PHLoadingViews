## About PHLoadingViews

This is a selection of simple native loading spinners. I hate animated GIFs because the animation is never smooth, so these simple UIView subclasses can be dropped in anywhere you need to show a loading spinner.

## How to use

There are two types of spinner to choose from, and each can be customized.

PHCircleFadeView uses a "fade" on each individual circle, while the PHCircleRotateView "rotates" the collection of circles as a whole. Each view will fill the frame given to it, or will size itself intrinsically.

For each view you can set properties for:

	* The number of circles
	* The size of the circles
	* The speed of the spinner
